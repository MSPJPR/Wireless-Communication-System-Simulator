4. Performance Metrics:

Calculates and displays key metrics like Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Bit Error Rate (BER).

Simulates performance across different channel conditions.



5. CSV Data Export:

Exports simulated data (e.g., SNR, BER) to a CSV file for offline analysis.



6. Fully Responsive Web Interface:

Designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring compatibility with mobile and desktop browsers.
